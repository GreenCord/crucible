# Crucible

This game represents an exercise to use the jQuery library to create a simple client-side browser game. 

## How to Play

1. Start a new game.
2. Select a character.
3. Select an opponent.
4. Attack until you win or lose. Repeat.

**Tip:** Each character can win depending on the order in which opponents are selected. You get stronger with each attack, but counter attack power remains the same.
